                <p>It might be unexpected, but this is a text. It conveys some information, tho not very important. You can actually ignore it with no consequences, so....</p>

                <p>By the second time you're probably expecting it to be a text. Can't blame you, it is expected, but I am quite sad that I can't surprise you anymore. You know what? Forget the text was there at all. Just go do something else please.</p>

                <p>So, did I manage to surprise you? I hope I did. I've spent a while making this text properly. You can even call it.... texty! Ha-ha! Texty! Yeah, feels right. I'm sure it is even classified as texty!</p>
